# Spectral_defense
A casual tower defense, animated by the will to make one and to animate some shadows, ghosts etc. 

## Concept
-------------
This tower defense if foremost an personal experience. Meanwhile I try to improve my skills, why wouldn't I do a game playable and enjoyable ? So here is the idea :

## Story
------------
I should invent one.

## Ennemy Units
-----------
Make a list, idiot !
* Ideas :
      * Basic ghost
      * Skeleton
      * zombie
      * Destroyer (damage the turrets)
      * Builder (Create a tower that helps)
      

## Ally turret
Make a list, idiot
* Ideas :
      * Arrow turret ( find a better name, scumbag)
      * Ice turret
      * Fire turret
      * Blocking turret
      * Teleporting turret
      * Large damage and area turret (scumbag)
      

## Gameplay
-----------
Who doesn't know the turret defense gameplay ? Some terrible units come to destroy your base, you need to defend it placing some overpowered turret on the free squares along the ennemy path. 
So, we have to 

1. Identify the sense of ennemy path (Where do they come from ?)
2. Identify the sensitive square (Where should I put a turret to maximise its impact ?)
3. Survive the large amount of waves to gain money and improve your turrets.

### TO DO LIST
* Gameplay:
	* Implement the money
	* Implement the turrets
	* Implement the enemies
	* Implement the path
	* Implement win/lose
	* Implement life ( unit and yours )

* Technical:
	* Working menu
	* Implement the pause capacity
	* Implement an easy way to add levels
	* **MAKE AN EDITOR** 

* Graphisms:
	* Find a sprite for the monsters
